        def your_action():

class Contexts:

            @hooks.filters.add("f1") def add_stuff_to_filter(...):

    The fact that our custom filter was added in a certain context allows us to later
    remove it. To do so, we write::

        from tutor import hooks
        hooks.filters.clear("f1", context="c1")
